# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

My First Homepage

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will create a website that introduces myself, my hobbies and anything interests to me, and also some fun facts about myself.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

There will be 4 interconnected pages in the website, introduction page, hobby/interest page, fun facts page, and contact page. I will use HTML to build the structure, CSS to make it look nice, and JavaScript for small interactive features. I will also use Bootstrap to make the design cleaner and mobile-friendly.
