Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

I have designed the basic structure of the homepage, including the layout and navigation. I’ve also started implementing the HTML and CSS to create the visual components, and I have integrated basic functionality like links and responsive design.

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I haven’t started adding JavaScript yet. There are still a lot of areas that need polish, like adding interactive features, improving the layout, and optimizing the website for mobile devices. Additionally, I need to finalize the content and ensure all elements work fine.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I’ve encountered problems with the style.css file not being applied to all pages except for index.html. I suspect it’s a problem with the file paths or linking structure. Also, I still need to refine the layout and make the website fully responsive across different screen sizes.
